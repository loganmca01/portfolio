      <h5>Customizable Toy Assembly Interpreter (in progress)</h5>

      <a href="https://github.com/loganmca01/toy_assembly_interpreter" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a>

      <p class = "no-bottom-pad">
        &#x2022; Toy assembly interpreter where the user can enter an instruction set using a custom, easy-to-read 
        register transfer notation, then run the commands dictated in the instruction set in a virtual environment. <br>
        &#x2022; Designed for use in Computer Organization class to introduce assembly concepts without
        full assembly syntax. <br>
        &#x2022; Two main components:
      </p>

      <p class = "indent">
        1. Instruction set parser: Takes a file input of instructions written in register transfer notation. Builds
        abstract syntax trees for each command, then puts them into symbol table for use in the user environment.<br>
        2. User command interpreter: Takes user commands (file or stdin) and runs them in virtual environment
        with an array of chars representing the stack, and variables for registers.<br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Instruction set example:<br><br>
        define ret {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP := BP;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BP := (SP);<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SP := SP + 2;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PC := (SP);<br>
        }<br><br>

      <h5>Computer Organizations Labs</h5>

      <a href="https://github.com/loganmca01/cs203_lab4_headers" target="_blank">Lab 4 Repo (headers only)</a><br>
      <a href="https://github.com/loganmca01/cs203_lab5_headers" target="_blank">Lab 5 Repo (headers only)</a>

      <p>
        Note: Full code available upon request. These repositories only have header files because the labs are still given in the course.<br><br>
        <strong>LAB 4:</strong><br>
        &#x2022; Focused around building fetch-decode-execute cycle for a toy assembly calculator. No string.h or built in string functions were allowed,
        we were required to build any string parsing or comparison functions ourselves. Registers were represented as binary strings. 
        Addition, subtraction, bitwise & |, negation, shifts, and conversions to decimal and hexadecimal were all implemented 
        going character by character through strings. No stack, just registers in simulated environment.<br><br>
        <strong>LAB 5:</strong><br>
        &#x2022;  Focused on expanding virtual environment from lab 4 with a more complex assembly language.
        Created "stack" with array of memory contents structs, which were built to store all relevant information
        about an item in memory, such as the command and arguments if the memory held an instruction. <br>

      <p class="no-bottom-pad">
        &#x2022; Given the sources below, we were tasked with creating a visualization tool for
        Pennsylvania school data, incorporating as much as we could to fit our needs.<br>
        &#x2022; My group opted to create as broad of a tool as possible, allowing the user freedom to compare
        whatever factors they wanted graphically as long as we had data for it.<br>
        &#x2022; My personal role in the group was database design. I created, implemented, and uploaded data to 
        our MySQL database, with the structure expanded on in the design document linked above. Additionally I 
        contributed to data cleaning, and writing the dynamic queries for the graphing utility.<br><br>
